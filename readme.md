## Code

#### Tables and Figures

[code/master_fig.R](https://github.com/pophealthdeterminantslab/county-level-estimates-of-excess-mortality/blob/master/code/master_fig.R) runs all the following scripts to reproduce tables and figures in the paper. All output files are in `output/`.

- [code/prelim_plot.R](https://github.com/pophealthdeterminantslab/county-level-estimates-of-excess-mortality/blob/master/code/prelim_plot.R) loads packages and common functions to run the scripts.
- [code/0_build_final_data_with_county.R](https://github.com/pophealthdeterminantslab/county-level-estimates-of-excess-mortality/blob/master/code/0_build_final_data_with_county.R) converts the county-set level data (each row represents a county set) to county level (each row represents a county). It also matches the metropolitan status and [BEA region](https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/definitions.cfm?did=243&reqId=70) to each county.
- [code/1_make_summary_table.R](https://github.com/pophealthdeterminantslab/county-level-estimates-of-excess-mortality/blob/master/code/1_make_summary_table.R) produces Table 1, Table A1 ([output/tab1_input.tex](https://github.com/pophealthdeterminantslab/county-level-estimates-of-excess-mortality/blob/master/output/tab1_input.tex)), and appendix Table C1 ([output/atab_c1_county_estimate_input.tex
](https://github.com/pophealthdeterminantslab/county-level-estimates-of-excess-mortality/blob/master/output/atab_c1_county_estimate_input.tex)). It calculates the weighted mean of key variables at different geographical levels. The variables include expected deaths, observed deaths, ratio of observed to expected deaths, excess deaths, excess deaths rate, COVID-19 deaths, ratio of COVID-10 to excess deaths, and number of county sets in each geographical level.
- [code/2_make_histogram.R](https://github.com/pophealthdeterminantslab/county-level-estimates-of-excess-mortality/blob/master/code/2_make_histogram.R) produces Figure 1 ([output/fig1_hist_2011_2020.png](https://github.com/pophealthdeterminantslab/county-level-estimates-of-excess-mortality/blob/master/output/fig1_hist_2011_2020.png)). It plots the distribution of all-cause death rate, excess death rate, and excess death rate excluding COVID-19 for 2011-2020. 
- [code/3_make_map.R](https://github.com/pophealthdeterminantslab/county-level-estimates-of-excess-mortality/blob/master/code/3_make_map.R) produces Figure 2 ([output/fig2_excess_death_map_bar.png](https://github.com/pophealthdeterminantslab/county-level-estimates-of-excess-mortality/blob/master/output/fig2_excess_death_map_bar.png)) and Figure 3 ([output/fig3_excess_not_covid_map_bar.png](https://github.com/pophealthdeterminantslab/county-level-estimates-of-excess-mortality/blob/master/output/fig3_excess_not_covid_map_bar.png)). It plots the county level map of excess death rate and percent of excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19, along with the 20 counties with the highest excess deaths and 20 counties with the lowest COVID-19 to excess ratio.
- [code/4_make_scatterplot_deathrate.R](https://github.com/pophealthdeterminantslab/county-level-estimates-of-excess-mortality/blob/master/code/4_make_scatterplot_deathrate.R) prodcues Figure 4 ([output/fig4_covid_excess_rate_scatterplot_region.png](https://github.com/pophealthdeterminantslab/county-level-estimates-of-excess-mortality/blob/master/output/fig4_covid_excess_rate_scatterplot_region.png)). It plots the COVID-19 death rate against excess death rate for each county set by metropolitan status and BEA region.
- [code/5_make_bar_excessnotcovid_county.R](https://github.com/pophealthdeterminantslab/county-level-estimates-of-excess-mortality/blob/master/code/5_make_bar_excessnotcovid_county.R) produces Figure 5 ([output/fig5_excess_not_covid_strict_negative.png](https://github.com/pophealthdeterminantslab/county-level-estimates-of-excess-mortality/blob/master/output/fig5_excess_not_covid_strict_negative.png)). It plots the 20 county sets with the highest excess death rate not assigned to COVID-19 and 14 county sets with strictly negative (confidence intervals below zero) excess death not assigned to COVID-19.
- [code/6_make_bar_excess_by_region.R](https://github.com/pophealthdeterminantslab/county-level-estimates-of-excess-mortality/blob/master/code/6_make_bar_excess_regionmetro.R) produces appendix Figure 1 ([output/afig1_excess_regionmetro_bar.png](https://github.com/pophealthdeterminantslab/county-level-estimates-of-excess-mortality/blob/master/output/afig1_excess_regionmetro_bar.png)). It plots excess death rate and ratio of COVID-19 to excess deaths by BEA region and metropolitan status.
- [code/7_make_time_series_plots.R](https://github.com/pophealthdeterminantslab/county-level-estimates-of-excess-mortality/blob/master/code/7_make_time_series_plots.R) produces appendix Figure 2 and 3 ([output/afig_time_series_stacked1.png](https://github.com/pophealthdeterminantslab/county-level-estimates-of-excess-mortality/blob/master/output/afig_time_series_stacked1.png) and [afig_time_series_stacked2.png](https://github.com/pophealthdeterminantslab/county-level-estimates-of-excess-mortality/blob/master/output/afig_time_series_stacked2.png)). It plots the time series of observed and expected deaths of the four most populous counties in each BEA region.
- [code/8_make_cum_pop_table.R](https://github.com/pophealthdeterminantslab/county-level-estimates-of-excess-mortality/blob/master/code/8_make_cum_pop_table.R) produces appendix Table A2 ([output/atab_a2_covid_excess_ratio_pop.tex](https://github.com/pophealthdeterminantslab/county-level-estimates-of-excess-mortality/blob/master/output/atab_a2_covid_excess_ratio_pop.tex)). It tabulates the number of population living in counties with different levels of assignment of excess deaths to COVID-19.
- [code/9_make_countyset_estimate_table.R](https://github.com/pophealthdeterminantslab/county-level-estimates-of-excess-mortality/blob/master/code/9_make_countyset_estimate_table.R) produces appendix Table C1 ([output/atab_c1_county_estimate_input.tex](https://github.com/pophealthdeterminantslab/county-level-estimates-of-excess-mortality/blob/master/output/atab_c1_county_estimate_input.tex)). It tabulates the key variables for each county set. The variables are identical to the ones in Table 1.
